Welcome to the Social Media Observatory (SMO) at the Leibniz Institute for Media Research \| Hans-Bredow-Institute!

<!--more-->

We will help researchers in the field of (social) media by enabling their data scraping, mining, and analysis potential and clarifying the legal and ethical boundaries for this kind of research.

We are an open project from the beginning and invite everyone interested to contribute.

Stay tuned! ([And ask us anything](mailto:smo@leibniz-hbi.de)) :)
