The "Database of Public Speakers" or "Datenbank Öffentlicher Sprecher" (DBÖS), our comprehensive and up-to-date collection of media, organizations, and individuals from Germany which contribute to public debates, has been updated to v2.

<!--more-->

With this update, the DBÖS consists of 7.743 entries, including basic publicly available information (e.g. party membership for politicians, or mode of financing for media outlets) as well as  public social media accounts (Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok) for each database entry, if existing. The dataset includes around 2.650 media accounts, e.g. all daily and weekly newspapers, news programmes of the main TV and Radio broadcasters, and news-orientied online-only outlets; about 750 national and regional party organisations and governmental agencies; and about 4.350 journalists and members of federal and regional parliaments. The dataset documentation describes the different types of public speakers as well as our sources and reports basic descriptive statistics.
