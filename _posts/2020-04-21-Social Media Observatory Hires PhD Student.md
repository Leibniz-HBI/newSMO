**The Leibniz-Institute for Media Research \| Hans-Bredow-Institut is hiring a Junior Researcher (m/f/d) in the field of Computational Social Science for our Social Media Observatory. We are looking forward to work with you from June 2020 (but a later start can be discussed).**

You will work in a small team of motivated people and support us in conceptualising and building up our [Social Media Observatory](https://https://leibniz-hbi.github.io/SMO/about/) – a project that will help many researchers within and outside the institute. You will contribute to and have first-hand access to the data we collect, the tools we curate and develop, and the infrastructure that we provide to realise your PhD project and get your doctorate.

Your PhD project will ideally deal with social and online media data and how it can help to understand social cohesion, with a focus on Germany (therefore good German language skills are required), but we are open for suggestions. Your supervision can either be provided by one of the professors at our institute or we are also happy to organise and accommodate external (co-)supervision (e.g. from the University of Hamburg, the University of Bremen, or your suggestion) if that better suits your subject.

Sounds like a plan for the next 3-4 years? Well, let us know!
